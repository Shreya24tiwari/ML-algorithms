##############################    LINEAR REGRESSION      ######################################
A linear regression is a good tool for quick predictive analysis: 
For Example, we want to find Employee yearly income Our Yearly income is Dependent Variable or test set
and employee work experience, employee age, employee occupation,employee last year income etc and these are our Indepent variable.
we need to build a linear regression, which predicts the line of best fit between them and can help conclude whether or not these two factors have a positive or negative relationship. 
This help us to find employee yearly income is increase or decrease.
