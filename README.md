##############################    LINEAR REGRESSION      ######################################
A linear regression is a good tool for quick predictive analysis: 
For Example, we want to find Employee yearly income Our Yearly income is Dependent Variable or test set
and employee work experience, employee age, employee occupation,employee last year income etc and these are our Indepent variable.
we need to build a linear regression, which predicts the line of best fit between them and can help conclude whether or not these two factors have a positive or negative relationship. 
This help us to find employee yearly income is increase or decrease.
In this linear regression the formula of the equation is Y = a + bX. Here X is INDEPENDENT VARIABLE(TRAIN OR EXPLANATORY) and X is DEPENDENT VARIABLE(TEST)
We want to plot how much of the variation in the y variable (in this case test scores) can be explained by variation in the x variable.

HOW WE FOUND THAT DATA IS MOST SUITABLE FOR LINEAR REGRESSION?????
Count data with higher means tend to be normally distributed and you can often use OLS(Ordinary Least Squares regression). However, count data with smaller means can be skewed, and linear regression might have a hard time fitting these data. So if data is not too much in right or left skewed then we use linear regression for that data.
ORDINARY LEAST SQUARES REGRESSION : USE THIS OLS METHOD TO FIND OUT OBSERVED VALUES AND PREDICT VALUES IN LINEAR REGRESSION.
